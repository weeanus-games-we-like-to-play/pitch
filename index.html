    <p>a game pitch from <b>joseph dominguez</b> ((just hear me out))</p>
    <p>deep from the underground we would like to play:</p>
    <p class="pad"><i>WEEANUS games we like to play</i></p>

    <div class="box floating">
        <p class="header rainbow">genre</p>
        <p>>>>><i>WEEANUS games we like to play</i> is a</p>
        <p><b>2 dimensional sight seeing sight being collect-a-ton flip screen platformer</b></p>
        <p>in the unabashed tradition of zed x spectrum games that were traded by children on playgrounds</p>
        <p>that were coded by teenagers in their bedroom</p>
        <p>who were trying their hardest to not become adults</p>
        <p>and stumbled upon what would grow up into the metroidvania style of game</p>
        <p>that were all shamelessly copying each other merely transposing new faces on old places</p>
        <p>rest Assured <i>WEEANUS games we like to play</i> will not be above it</p>

    <div class="box side-to-side">
        <p class="header rainbow">game dESIGN</p>
        <p>the game will be a series of interconnected screens where</p>
        <p>ounces of sought after video gratification enjoyment will come from exploring the wonderful world of <i>WEEANUS games we like to play</i></p>
        <p>the game world environment presents you in stunning some-definition claritiy</p>
        <p>as the player explores the world , more options to better explore the world will open up</p>
        <p>tight challenging "br00tal" platforming will be expected from the player in exchange for this privilege</p>
        <p>and even the most skilled and dedicated of players</p>
        <p>will be >on the tips of their tipsy toes</p>
        <img class="right" src="monty.gif">
        <p>oh and youll only have a certain amount of lives before you have to start over from</p>
        <p>the designated save rest stops peppered across the game world for the players convenience</p>
        <p>players will be trained into believing that their only goal is to collect all the items that you <b>can</b> collect for a special reward</p>
        <p>meet like minded individuals who share your interests in your game area</p>
        <p>work your way up to the top of the simulation ladder and prove you still got it</p>

        <p class="header rainbow">GRAPHICS AND SOUND</p>
        <p>the visual audio presentation will be in 2 dimensional stereoeoeoeo</p>
        <p>describing the visual style would take away from the immersion</p>
        <p>a suRreal clash of mish mash should stand on its own</p>
        <p>really rudimentary stuff, just need some sprites and we'll be good to go</p>
        <p>the user interface will contain only what is necessary, a lives count and a item count</p>
        <p>a dialogue system will need to be made to allow players to converse with individuals who really have something to say</p>
        <p>the effects will be all bits and bloops and extracted from nature recordings</p>
        <p>the music will be composed by Me and will sound like it belongs</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <p class="header rainbow">artificial intelligence</p>
        <p>the artificial intelligence will be simple</p>
        <p>enemies and harzards will follow pre determined paths and whatnots within each screen of the game</p>
        <p>and perhaps more complex enemies could be programmed into the game but thatd be ... devilish</p>
    </div>


    <div class="box">
        <p class="header rainbow">PHYSICs</p>
        <p>no physics will be needed for this game except for the gravity that</p>
        <p>affects the player dragging them down if the player chooses to defy it</p>
        <p>adding slight momentum to the players movement would not be a half-bad idea either</p>
        <p>there will have to be obligatory ice blocks that are slippery too, cant EVER forget those</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box side-to-side">
        <p class="header rainbow">FEATURES</p>
        <p>> immersive game world to get lost in</p>
        <p>> countless conversations to hold with lively new friends</p>
        <p>> jump and dodge and weave in and out of harms way</p>
        <p>> plenty of pointless knick knack items to collect you can never have enough</p>
        <p>> save at any one of the many save rest stops in the game</p>      
        <p>> fun!!</p>

        <p class="header rainbow">MODULES</p>
        <p><b>Class: Screen</b></p>
        <p>the screen class will hold all of the modificatable values that a screen could possibly have like gravity and the name of the screen</p>
        <p><b>Class: Block</b></p>
        <p>the block class will be the meta class that will define the behavior blocks will have and what the block will look like</p>
        <p><b>Class: Player</b></p>
        <p>the player class will contain all the necessary values that will need to be tracked like health and number of items collected</p>
        <p>the player class will need methods that will interface with the enemy and item classes</p>
        <p><b>Class: Enemy</b></p>
        <p>the enemy class will be the meta class that will define the behavior for enemies and contain all the necessary values like damage and move speed</p>
        <p>the enemy class will have to have methods in place that will interface with the players health values</p>
        <p><b>Class: Item</b></p>
        <p>the item class will really just be an glorified block that will have a method that interfaces with the player to add to their item count</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box floating right">
        <p class="header rainbow">group</p>
        <p>a smaller group would be more suited towards the game</p>
        <p>more focus will be put towards the feel and map design of the game as</p>
        <p>the game play will be decidely more simple</p>
